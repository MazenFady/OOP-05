/*
 Define 3D Point Class and the basic Constructors (use chaining in constructors).

Override the ToString Function to produce this output:
Point3D P = new Point3D (10,10,10);
Console. WriteLine (P. ToString( ));
Output: “Point Coordinates: (10, 10, 10)”.
 Read from the User the Coordinates for 2 points P1, P2 (Check the input using try Pares, Parse, Convert).

Try to use ==
If (P1 == P2)   Does it work properly? 
Define an array of points and sort this array based on X & Y coordinates.
Implement ICloneable interface to be able to clone the object.
To implement more than one interface.
class Point3D:IComparable ,ICloneable 


Second Project:
Define Class Maths that has four methods: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide, each of them takes two parameters. Call each method in Main ().
 Modify the program so that you do not have to create an instance of class to call the four methods.
